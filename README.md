# Covid19Pandemic-Analysis-Across-Americas-Asia-Europe
# Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data across the American continent, with comparisons to Asia and Europe. The goal is to identify patterns and trends related to the spread of COVID-19, focusing on total positive cases, new cases, and deaths. Specifically, the analysis examines how COVID-19 impacted different countries within the American continent and how these trends compare to those in other major continents. Using Tableau for visualization, the project provides insights into the progression of the pandemic across time and highlights the countries most affected by COVID-19.

This analysis was conducted as part of a second-semester Data Mining and Visualization course. While the project provides valuable initial insights through visualizations, further in-depth analysis is required, including coding-based data manipulation, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, to explore additional factors influencing the pandemic's progression.

# Case Description
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries worldwide, and understanding its progression is crucial for health authorities and decision-makers. This project examines COVID-19 data from America, Asia, and Europe, with a special focus on the American continent. The case explores:
- Total positive COVID-19 cases
- Newly reported cases
- Deaths related to COVID-19
- Comparative analysis of the pandemic’s impact across different continents and countries
The aim of this analysis is to highlight the most affected regions and countries, as well as provide insights into the trajectory of the pandemic across time.

# Objectives
- Visualize and compare the spread of COVID-19 across America, Asia, and Europe.
- Analyze trends in positive cases, new cases, and deaths in the American continent.
- Identify the countries in America with the highest number of cases and deaths.
- Provide a comparative view of the pandemic's impact on different countries and continents.
- Present a clear and structured analysis through Tableau visualizations to inform further decision-making.

# Project Steps and Features
The project consists of five Tableau Storyboard dashboards that explore different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic:
1. COVID-19 Cases in America, Asia, and Europe
- A dual-line chart displaying cumulative positive cases and new cases from January to - December across the three continents.
America shows the highest cumulative cases, followed by Asia and Europe.
- The new cases graph highlights peaks in different months for each continent, showing how the pandemic spread differently across regions.

2. COVID-19 Cases in the American Continent
- A choropleth map shows the distribution of positive cases in the Americas, with Brazil and the United States leading in total cases.
- A bar chart below the map lists the number of positive cases by country, providing detailed statistical insights for each region.

3. New COVID-19 Cases in America
- A similar layout to the previous dashboard, but focused on new cases reported in December.
- The United States reported the highest new cases, followed by Brazil and Colombia.

4. Comparison of Total Cases vs New Cases
- A side-by-side bar chart comparing total cases and new cases for each country in America.
- The chart shows how countries like Brazil and the United States have both high total and new cases, reflecting ongoing transmission.

5. COVID-19 Deaths in America
- This dashboard focuses on deaths, showing both cumulative deaths and new deaths in December.
- Brazil, Mexico, and the United States reported the highest number of deaths, emphasizing the pandemic’s severe impact on these countries.

# Tools
The project used Tableau to create the entire visual storyboard and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 data.

# Challenges
- No coding implementation: The project relies solely on Tableau for visualization, which limits data manipulation and preprocessing capabilities. Further development using programming languages like Python or R would be needed to enhance the analysis.
- Data limitations: The data used in this analysis focuses on positive cases, new cases, and deaths. More comprehensive analysis could involve additional variables like vaccination rates or hospitalization data.
- No predictive modeling: The current storyboard presents a retrospective analysis. Predictive modeling could provide future insights into the progression of the pandemic.

# Conclusion
This project provides a structured, visual representation of COVID-19 data across America, Asia, and Europe, with a special focus on the American continent. Using Tableau, the project visualizes key trends in total cases, new cases, and deaths, highlighting the most affected countries and regions. America and Brazil are shown to have the highest number of both cases and deaths, reflecting the severity of the pandemic in these regions.

However, since the analysis was performed entirely using Tableau without any coding, there is potential for further work. The addition of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling would significantly enhance the depth of insights derived from the data. The project demonstrates the power of visual storytelling but requires further development for a more comprehensive analysis.
